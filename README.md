## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed locally.
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the service account created with t least the 'iam.serviceAccounts.create' permission to create a service account and other permissions like 'container.clusters.create' and 'container.clusters.get' to create and manage GKE clusters.
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
- A service account key file (JSON format) for GCP with permissions to create and manage resources. Should be named 'key-file.json' in the sub-directory './service-account'.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ftptomongo-infrastructure.git
cd ftptomongo-infrastructure
```

## Configuration

In the `variables.tf` file, you can configure the following variables:

- `credentials`: The path to your service account key file.
- `cluster_name`: The name of the GKE cluster.
- `project`: Your GCP project ID.
- `project_id`: A description of your GCP project (optional).
- `location`: The GCP region where resources will be deployed.
- `zone`: The GCP zone for the GKE cluster.
- `initial_node_count`: The initial number of nodes in the GKE cluster.
- `machine_type`: The machine type for GKE nodes.
- `service_account_name`: The name of the service account to create.
- `service_account_ID`: The service account ID (leave empty for automatic generation).

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

2. **Apply Configuration**:

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:

```shell
terraform apply
```

3. **Access Kubernetes Cluster**:

After successful deployment, configure `kubectl` to access the GKE cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ftptomongo-cluster --zone europe-west1-b --project smooth-verve-400915
```

Replace the cluster name, zone, and project with your configuration.

4. **Verify Resources**:

Check the status of your resources and nodes:

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

## Cleanup

To destroy the created resources and infrastructure, run:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
